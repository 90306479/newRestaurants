# Restaurant Reviews

This Restaurant Reviews app is a project that I worked on at the start of advanced iOS app development. I was having trouble deciding on an app to focus on at the beginning of advanced iOS developement, so I followed an apple developement tutorial to create the initial application and to act as a refresher for what I learned last year.

From there, I used the basic app structure and reformed the app to focus on restaurants in my city rather than landmarks(the subject the tutorial focused on) so it was more fit to be used by friends and family in my area. I learned about incorporating data from .json files, layering screens, working with mapview and coordinates, and manipulating objects. Using data from a .json file was particularly challenging for me because if the file had any sort of small error the entire program would not function, so doing so required a lot of debugging. Once I had reworked the app to be more useful to me and my own peers, I started talking to friends and family about what features they would find useful in an app to track restaurants. I worked to add the functionality of reviewing the restaurants on a scale from 1-5, and manipulated the mapview feature so the restaurants in the list could all be displayed on one map together. 


After working with this app for over a week I chose to continue my learning with different apps, but if I were to continue on my restaurants app there are still many features I would like to add. I would like the user to be able to add new restaurants into the app of their choosing, as well add the ability to write reviews of the restaurants along with giving them a rating. I would also add in the ability for users of the app to connect with one another so they can see what restaurants their peers are eating at and how they reviewed them.
